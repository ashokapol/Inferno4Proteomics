DAnTE - Data Analysis Tool Extension

This package contains latest release of DAnTE.
DAnTE can perform various downstream analyses on large scale datasets from proteomics and microarrays.

Among many features of DAnTE are:
* A set of diagnostic plots (Histograms, boxplots, correlation plots, qq-plots, peptide-protein rollup plots, MA plots, PCA plots, etc).
* Log transforming.
* Rolling up to proteins (3 methods are available).
* LOESS normalization
* Linear Regression Normalization
* Mean Centering
* Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) Adjustment across datasets
* Quantile Normalization
* Principal Component Analysis
* Partial Least Squares Analysis
* ANOVA (multi-way, unbalanced, random effects)
* Heatmaps with Hierarchical and K-means cluster options

Dependencies:

DAnTE depends on the following:
1. Windows XP with .NET 2.0 framework (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/)
2. R Statistical Environment (http://www.r-project.org/)
3. statconnDCOM server (http://rcom.univie.ac.at/)

DAnTE uses the following R packages (from http://cran.r-project.org/):
* amap: Another Multidimensional Analysis Package
* car: Companion to Applied Regression
* nlme: Linear and Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models
* outliers: Tests for outliers
* fpc: Fixed point clusters, clusterwise regression and discriminant plots
* pls: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Principal Component Regression (PCR)
* MASS: Main Package of Venables and Ripley's MASS
* impute: Imputation for microarray data
* qvalue: Q-value estimation for false discovery rate control
* e1071: Misc Functions of the Department of Statistics (e1071), TU Wien
* gplots: Various R programming tools for plotting data
* ellipse: Functions for drawing ellipses and ellipse-like confidence regions
* plotrix: Various plotting functions
* scatterplot3d: 3D Scatter Plot
* colorspace: Colorspace Manipulation

DAnTE also uses PeptideFileExtractorConsole application written by Matthew Monroe and
PeptideFileExtractor and FileConcatenator DLLs written by Ken Auberry, for Sequest output file processing.
